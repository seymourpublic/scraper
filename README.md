This code is a Python script that performs web scraping to retrieve product prices from three different websites: "Court Order," "Superbalist," and "Studio 88." It then stores this pricing data in a SQLite database using the Pony ORM library and exports it to a CSV file. Here's a brief breakdown of its functionality:

    The script defines a SQLite database schema using Pony ORM, creating a table called "Item" to store product name, price, and creation date.

    It defines functions for extracting product prices from the three websites using the BeautifulSoup library. Each function takes a session object for making HTTP requests and returns a tuple containing the website name and the product price.

    The "export_data_to_csv" function takes the data retrieved from the websites and writes it to a CSV file named "items.csv." It uses the 'csv' module to handle CSV file creation and writing.

    In the "main" function, a session is created for making HTTP requests with a specific user-agent. The prices from the three websites are fetched, and the data is stored in a list.

    The retrieved data is printed to the console, and then the "export_data_to_csv" function is called to save the data to the CSV file.

Overall, this code demonstrates web scraping, data storage in a database, and data export to a CSV file for monitoring product prices from multiple websites.
